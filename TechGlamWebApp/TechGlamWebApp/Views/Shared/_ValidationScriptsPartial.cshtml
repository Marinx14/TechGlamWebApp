/**
 * This partial view is responsible for including the necessary JavaScript files for client-side validation.
 * It includes the jQuery Validation plugin and the jQuery Unobtrusive Validation plugin.
 * These plugins are used to perform client-side validation on form inputs based on the validation attributes defined in the model.
 * The jQuery Validation plugin provides the core validation functionality, while the jQuery Unobtrusive Validation plugin integrates with ASP.NET Core's validation attributes.
 * By including these scripts, client-side validation is enabled for forms in the application.
